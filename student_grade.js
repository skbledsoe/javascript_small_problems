/*
  Write a program to determine a studentâ€™s grade based on the average of three scores you get from the user. Use these rules to compute the grade:

  - If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the grade is 'A'
  - If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 90 then the grade is 'B'
  - If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 70 then the grade is 'C'
  - If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'

  You may assume that all input values are valid positive integers.


  EXAMPLE:
  // prompts to get the 3 scores
    => Enter score 1: 90
    => Enter score 2: 50
    => Enter score 3: 78

  // log to the console
    => Based on the average of your 3 scores your letter grade is "B".


  algo:
    assign score1, score2, and score3 to separate user input, explicitly coercing into a number

    add each of the three variables and divide by 3, save that value to a new variable called average

    declare local variable called letterGrade

    if average is >= 90,
      assign letterGrade to 'A'
    if  >= 70 and <90
      'B'
    if >= 50 and < 70
      'C'
    if <50
      'F'

  log message to console displaying letter grade
